**Overview**

The Baggage Claim Simulator is a C++ project that models the journey of airline luggage from check-in to claim. The simulator provides two user interfaces — one for airport employees and one for passengers — allowing each to interact with the system in realistic ways.

The project demonstrates skills in object-oriented design, data structures, and simulation modeling, with a focus on reliability and user experience.

**Key Features**

Employee Interface

Secure login for administrators and staff

Manage checked bags (status, location, flight assignment)

View passenger manifests and unclaimed baggage

Contact passengers about lost luggage

Passenger Interface

Check bag status and pickup time

View flight arrival/departure details and gate info

Report bag concerns

Core Simulation

Bag journey modeled from check-in to carousel pickup

Includes queues, linked lists, and stacks for realistic baggage handling

Handles scenarios like overhead bin space limits and unclaimed baggage lists

Sends notifications for key events (bag loaded, unloaded, picked up)


**Skills Demonstrated**

C++ programming (OOP, data structures, file I/O)

Simulation design and modeling

Queue, linked list, and stack data structures in practice

User interface design (console-based)

Systems thinking & requirements analysis

Future Improvements
